Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come first, 
then all nodes with value equal to x and finally nodes with value greater than x. 
The original relative order of the nodes in each of the three partitions should be preserved. 
The partition must work in-place.
 
Example 1:
Input:
1->4->3->2->5->2->3,
x = 3
Output:
1->2->2->3->3->4->5
Explanation: 
Nodes with value less than 3 come first, 
then equal to 3 and then greater than 3.
Example 2:
Input:
1->4->2->10 
x = 3
Output: 
1->2->4->10
Explanation:
Nodes with value less than 3 come first,
then equal to 3 and then greater than 3.
Your task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function partition()
 which takes the head of the inked list and an integer x as input, and returns the head of the 
 modified linked list after arranging the values according to x.
 
Expected time complexity : O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)
 
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= k <= 105

Algorithm


1) Initialize first and last nodes of below three linked lists as NULL. 
    a) Linked list of values smaller than x.
    b) Linked list of values equal to x.
    c) Linked list of values greater than x.
2) Now iterate through the original linked list. If a nodeâ€™s value is less than x then 
append it at the end of the smaller list. If the value is equal to x, then at the end 
of the equal list. And if a value is greater, then at the end of the greater list.
3) Now concatenate three lists.
