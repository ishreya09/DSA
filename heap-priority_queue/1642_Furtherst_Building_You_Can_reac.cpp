1642. Furthest Building You Can Reach
Medium

https://leetcode.com/problems/furthest-building-you-can-reach/

You are given an integer array heights representing the heights of buildings, some bricks, and some ladders.

You start your journey from building 0 and move to the next building by possibly using bricks or ladders.

While moving from building i to building i+1 (0-indexed),

If the current building's height is greater than or equal to the next building's height, you do not need a ladder or bricks.
If the current building's height is less than the next building's height, you can either use one ladder or (h[i+1] - h[i]) bricks.
Return the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given ladders and bricks optimally.

 

Example 1:


Input: heights = [4,2,7,6,9,14,12], bricks = 5, ladders = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Starting at building 0, you can follow these steps:
- Go to building 1 without using ladders nor bricks since 4 >= 2.
- Go to building 2 using 5 bricks. You must use either bricks or ladders because 2 < 7.
- Go to building 3 without using ladders nor bricks since 7 >= 6.
- Go to building 4 using your only ladder. You must use either bricks or ladders because 6 < 9.
It is impossible to go beyond building 4 because you do not have any more bricks or ladders.
Example 2:

Input: heights = [4,12,2,7,3,18,20,3,19], bricks = 10, ladders = 2
Output: 7
Example 3:

Input: heights = [14,3,19,3], bricks = 17, ladders = 0
Output: 3
 

Constraints:

1 <= heights.length <= 105
1 <= heights[i] <= 106
0 <= bricks <= 109
0 <= ladders <= heights.length

Algorithm 

1. The main concept is we can use ladder for any height. So suppose you are moving from the first building. 
Use bricks first upto as much you can go. When bricks are finished if height is more than maximum bricks 
used in a step use ladder or take the bricks from the biggest step and replace that with ladder. 
Now continue till ladders are finished and bricks are not sufficient.
2. So we can take a priority queue for storing the bricks used in each step and so that we can take out 
the maximum bricks used till a building. We add brick count to the queue whenever we use bricks and take out 
the max brick whenever we use ladder.
3. To reduce complexity of code we can provide brick at each step and if the brick count becomes negetive 
then add a ladder at the biggest step (In this way we no need to compare the current step with the max brick used 
before, priority queue will handle the situation).
4. Similarly give ladder to a step when needed. If ladder count becomes negetive then we cant go to next building 
and return the index of present building.
