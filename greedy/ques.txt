GREEDY
Please go ahead and attempt all the questions to get the feel of the Greedy Algorithm.
The greedy Algorithm is the most generalized topic from a story-based question's point of view. 
One of the most asked topics in OA for almost all Tier-2 Companies, couple of Tier-1 as well.

General Approach: Try to approach the problem from a general mindset rather than thinking from
a program point of view. Once you get that, slowly try to link it in terms of programming, followed by DSA. 
Usually, the approach to the majority of the questions(not always true though) is, it requires sorting and
based on the question asked you need to tweak your sorted output!.

NOTE: ALL THE QUESTIONS MAY NOT BE SOLELY TAGGED TO GREEDY, MAY REQUIRE OTHER CONCEPTS AS WELL.
