/*

1. How to create a vector that takes n number of inputs and enter it into the vector using v[0],v[1] = value method,
rather than using push_back() func

2. Unordered_map / set - do they initialize all values to 0 in case of integer data type? In which part of the memory
segment is it stored?

3. Why is & used in vector while using pass by reference- how are the pointers working in that case?

4. Can't we use substrings like str[0:3] ?
