/*
Modifiers: 

assign() – It assigns new value to the vector elements by replacing old ones
push_back() – It push the elements into a vector from the back
pop_back() – It is used to pop or remove elements from a vector from the back.
insert() – It inserts new elements before the element at the specified position
erase() – It is used to remove elements from a container from the specified position or range.
swap() – It is used to swap the contents of one vector with another vector of same type. Sizes may differ.
clear() – It is used to remove all the elements of the vector container
emplace() – It extends the container by inserting new element at position
emplace_back() – It is used to insert a new element into the vector container, the new element is added to the end of the vector

/*
The time complexity for doing various operations on vectors is-

Random access – constant O(1)
Insertion or removal of elements at the end – constant O(1)
Insertion or removal of elements – linear in the distance to the end of the vector O(N)
Knowing the size – constant O(1)
Resizing the vector- Linear O(N)
