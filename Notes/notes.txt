The C++ Standard Template Library (STL)
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/the-c-standard-template-library-stl/

The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions 
such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc. It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators. It is a generalized library 
and so, its components are parameterized. Working knowledge of template classes is a prerequisite for working with STL. 

STL has 4 components:

Algorithms
Containers
Functions
Iterators


sigma
