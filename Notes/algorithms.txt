std::sort(): The sort() function is widely used by the programmers. 
The sort() function allows you to sort the given array or vector. 
It takes the name and size as the parameter in the array's case and the 
starting point and the endpoint in the case of the vector. The sort() 
function is a hybrid of heap sort and quicksort.

std::swap(): The swap() function is another STL algorithm template. 
The swap() function lets you swap two entities. It accepts the two 
entities that are to be swapped as their parameters. This function 
saves you from hard work.

std::reverse(): The reverse() function is used to return the elements 
in an order which will be the reverse of the original order. This function 
accepts two parameters, the iterators storing the memory addresses of the first 
and the last entity. The first iterator will point to the first entity from 
which the elements need to be reversed, and the last iterator will point to the 
last element up to which the values need to be reversed.    

Other popular algorithm templates used are: std:: min(), std::max(), std::swap(), std::rotate(), 
std::reverse(), std::min_element(), std::max_element(), std:: binary_search().
